# Spatial GIS Python/R pipeline
### NOTICE: The following work is the original creation of Marko Tyhansky and is not permitted for use without consent of original author.
#### This project is a showcase in personal skills with Python including but not limited to:
R, Python, subprocess, pandas, terra, raster, and data visualization
This project was done through the combined efforts of myself and Michael Olds (oldsm@wit.edu) that took the ground work of my original R code and expanded it to allow a means for mining clear landmass images by filtering through cloudy images (noise).
